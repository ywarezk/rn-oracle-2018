#### About the lecture

- two parts, react and react native
- our goal is to familiarize with the technologies, to have a good starting point
- all code will be in the url: github.com/ywarezk/rn-oracle-2018

#### What is React

- Library to create UI
- we split the UI to blocks
- we split according to seperation of concerns
- each block is called a React Component
- a block contains the view part and the logic
- react will know how to react to changes and update the DOM
- open source maintained by facebook
- in production since 2012 open sourced in 2013

#### Hello World JS

In this section we showed how to create an hello world using JS.
We manipulate the DOM, explained about the DOM tree. 

#### Hello World React

Init npm and install react and react-dom. 
React.createElement are the atoms of our ui block of our react components
we are building a tree of react elements
react dom will connect that tree to the dom
with react we are not modifying the dom directly rather we are building a virtual dom
react will make sure to update the dom according to the virtual dom
with React.createElement we can nest elements to combine react elements atoms together to form a molecule. 
The molecule is our component

#### what is react native

#### react-native-cli

used to create a new react native app

#### run the app on emulator

- npm start
- react-native run-ios

#### some react native components
- View
- Text
- Button
- FlatList
